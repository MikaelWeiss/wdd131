			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site is meant to help people keep track of what they have eaten throughout the day. This is particularly helpfull for people who have stomach problems, where keeping track of what they eat can help them zone in on problematic foods that hurt their stomach.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is for people who have sensitive stomachs, or have stomach problems, or are trying to lose or gain weight.</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The site will have a form that allows the user to input the food they have eaten and the date they ate it, and the site will then display the food in a list that the user can search through. The user can then click on the food entry to see more details about it.</p>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
            <p>Most of this page will be a list of the meal entries from the user, so there isn't much copy. There will be a list that they can search through, and it'll be sorted by date, most recent on the top.</p>
			<h3>Meal Details</h3>
			<p>This page will have specific details about a meal entry, so there isn't any specific copy for it since it depends on the content the user adds.</p>
			<h3>About</h3>
