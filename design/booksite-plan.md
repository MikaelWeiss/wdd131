# Book Site Plan

## Purpose:
The purpose of this site is to make it easier for parents to get a quick understanding of important book details. This will help them be able to quickly decide whether or not their kids can read certain books.

## Audience:
Audience includes families with middle age to teen kids. Specificially families with higher moral standards and parents who want to keep their kids reading up to that standard.

## Content Needed
There will need to be a way for people to add their review of books as well as relevant information. People need to see the profiles of other users who do the reviews. A way to tap in to some sort of book api would be good so people can search up books and the site can say whether or not there is a review for that book.

## Other features:
The site might look different for the adults accounts and kids accounts. Kids might be more interested if the book seems exciting while the parents might be more interested if they think the book is approrpiat for their child.
